Do not remove this file, it's a template that you can copy-paste. The file name should start with
the team or topic (eg NAV, MISC, CORE, PS, UE, OP...), and next contain the title of the work done.

The 'title' field should start with something like Feature, Fix, Improve, Analytics, Documentation
etc.

The 'url' field should be a link to your Jira issue if you have one, otherwise add a link to the
GitLab merge request.

The 'author' field should be your name.

In addition, you can add an _optional_ description using Markdown here, eg adding links to
Confluence pages or further describing the change.
